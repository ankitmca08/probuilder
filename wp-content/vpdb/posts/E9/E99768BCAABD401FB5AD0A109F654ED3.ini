<h4 class=\"heding1\">A tiered program to allow opportunities for athletes of all levels to gain sponsorship.</h4>
<p class=\"ptext\">Here at Probuilder we are using our sponsorship program to find hard working and motivated people to work with. Our athlete management team has designed our sponsorship program to allow any athlete/individual the opportunity of sponsorship no matter the size of their social following. To enable this diverse type of sponsorship a tiered system has been put in place (Bronze Athlete, Silver Athlete, Gold Athlete, Full Sponsorship). You will find each tier is geared towards different levels of social following and brand participation.</p>
<p class=\"ptext\">An example of this would be a Bronze Athlete who would have a reasonable following of at least 800-1000 people on all the major social platforms and would expect to receive bronze tier benefits. At the other end of this scale is a Gold Athlete who is a beast on social media (20,000+ followers) and commands a wide social presence and would, therefore, receive the benefits that come with Gold Athlete Sponsorship. When we gauge tiers though it is important to note we are not looking at just one thing, therefore an athlete could be on a much higher level than other athletes because of special determining factors that are taken into account when creating the partnership. So there is definitely x factor characteristics at play like brand participation and level within ones chosen sports that can make a difference.</p>
